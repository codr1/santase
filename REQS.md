# Requirements

<!--
REQS.md is your unstructured requirements backlog.
Write features, bugs, and ideas here in any format.

When you run `wf plan`, Claude analyzes this file and proposes stories.
Sections get marked with WIP tags when stories are created, and
removed when stories are merged.

Examples:
- User authentication with OAuth
- Fix: logout button doesn't work on mobile
- Add dark mode support
