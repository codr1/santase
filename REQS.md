RULESET 2:
Santase Rules

Santase is not a commonly played card game but it is a lot of fun. This two-player game, popular in Eastern Europe, is challenging and competitive. Give it a try.


Decide who leads by gentleman's agreement or any means you like. This player will lay down a card. The opponent will do then do the same. 






<!-- BEGIN WIP: STORY-0010 -->
Here's one more complicating rule. At any point in the game, while the stock pile still has cards in inventory, a player may close the deck. That means players enter the final phase of the game as if the stock pile was exhausted.
<!-- END WIP -->


<!-- BEGIN WIP: STORY-0011 -->
Keep playing until someone reaches 10 points or any point level you agreed upon in advance.
<!-- END WIP -->


RULESET 3: 
How to Play Santase

Card Scoring

Closing the Deck
<!-- BEGIN WIP: STORY-0010 -->
At any point in the game, provided there are at least 3 cards remaining in the deck plus the displayed trump card, a player may close the deck. To do this, turn over the displayed trump card. You must do this at the start of your turn and you must be leading (laying down first). Then the game proceeds as in the "run-off".
<!-- END WIP -->

Game Scoring

<!-- BEGIN WIP: STORY-0011 -->
Games are played to any point value the players agree on. Typically, the first person to reach 11 points wins.
